# Secure Service with JWT Authentication

Istio sidecar can validate JWT token as defined by RFC 7519. You can check more detail in OpenID connect 1.0 (OIDC) and OAuth 2.0


## Setup

Create frontend and backend application (same as previous lab) along with Istio gateway,virtual service for frontend.

We need istio gateway because we want frontend app to authenticate by JWT token.

```
oc delete -f ocp/frontend-route.yml -n $USERID
oc apply -f ocp/frontend-v1-deployment.yml -n $USERID
oc apply -f ocp/frontend-service.yml -n $USERID
oc apply -f ocp/backend-v1-deployment.yml -n $USERID
oc apply -f ocp/backend-v2-deployment.yml -n $USERID
oc apply -f ocp/backend-service.yml -n $USERID
oc apply -f istio-files/frontend-gateway.yml -n $USERID
oc apply -f istio-files/virtual-service-frontend.yml -n $USERID
watch oc get pods -n $USERID

```

## Authentication Policy

Review [frontend-jwt-authentication.yml](../istio-files/frontend-jwt-authentication.yml)

```
...
targets:
  - name: frontend
  origins:
  - jwt:
      issuer: "http://voravit.example.com:8080/auth/realms/quickstart"
      jwksUri: "https://gitlab.com/workshop6/service-mesh/raw/master/keycloak/jwks.json"
...

```

This authentication policy is configured with

* Target service is frontend
* Issuer (iss) must be http://voravit.example.com:8080/auth/realms/quickstart
* URL of the providerâ€™s public key set to validate signature of the JWT is located at https://gitlab.com/workshop6/service-mesh/raw/master/keycloak/jwks.json

Apply authentication policy 

```

oc apply -f istio-files/frontend-jwt-authentication.yml -n $USERID

```

For testing purpose, JWT token that satisfied with above requirments is genereated by Red Hat Single Sign-On (or its upstream Keycloak) and also set token validity period to 10 years (This is for simplied steps for test JWT. Normally, default validity duration of token is 1 minutes)

You can check JWT token by get content of [jwt.txt](../keycloak/jwt.txt) and decode with [jwt.io](http://jwt.io)

Another token ([jwt-wrong-realm.txt](../keycloak/jwt-wrong-realm.txt) is generated with another Issuer for testing.

Following show decoded JWT token. Check for iss that is same value as issuer in authentication policy

## Test

JWT authentication is specified in HTTP header as follow.

```

Authorization: Bearer <token>

```

Test with token which issue from invalid issuer.

```

GATEWAY_URL=$(oc get route istio-ingressgateway -n $USERID-istio-system -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
TOKEN=$(cat keycloak/jwt-wrong-realm.txt)
curl -v --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" $GATEWAY_URL

```

Sample output

```

....
< HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
...
...
Origin authentication failed.* Closing connection 0

```

Test again with valid JWT token

```

TOKEN=$(cat keycloak/jwt.txt)
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" $GATEWAY_URL

```

With valid JWT token, you will get response from Frontend app.

```

Frontend version: v1 => [Backend: http://backend:8080, Response: 200, Body: Backend version:v2, Response:200, Host:backend-v2-7699759f8f-8pxj8, Status:200, Message: Hello, World]

```

## Clean Up

Run oc delete command to remove Istio policy.

```

oc delete -f istio-files/frontend-jwt-authentication.yml -n $USERID
oc delete -f istio-files/frontend-gateway.yml -n $USERID
oc delete -f istio-files/virtual-service-frontend.yml -n $USERID

```
